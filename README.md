# Godot 3 water shader
![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/c8sUFNU.png)

This is a water shader with optional **chromatic aberration**, it has some options to tweak like **tilling** (To adjust waves scale), **Murky ramp** (To make it more or less "cloudy"), *water tint colors* (To make muddy water o caribean like), etc. 
It problably needs some optimization or has some bugs (since is one of my first incursions in shader coding) so please you are welcome to post issues or improvements.

**Only works on Godot 3.x, with GLES 3 backend for now.**
